6.1 Tools Used to Create Diagram
Req 1.0
	Creation of tank the the player will be able to use.
Code:
	Def  Tank():         Def  Tank(x,x1,y,z)
				                    // Dimensions of the tank
				                    result = set()
				                    return result
Req 1.0.1
	Rules for tank movement
Code:
	void tankMovement()
	     	// Speed is just for an example value
		// Will move with same controls as character
		int tank_velocity = 2;
		//Block height 1 more than current level of tank automatically move on top of block
Req 1.0.2
	Despawn the tank after 5 collisions with projectile block
Code:
	int tankHealth()
		int tankHp = 5;
		//Check for collision with projectile block
		//If collision tankHp--
		if(tankHp == 0)
			// boot player out of tank and delete tank object
		return tankHp;	
Req 1.1, 1.2, 1.2.2, 1.2.3
	While in the tank tank right click will shoot a projectile out of the tank 
Code:
	void fireTankShell()
		double tankShell_y = tankHeight
		//Speed of projectile in X and Y direction to get a range of 15 blocks on a flat surface
		//Speeds below are for an example
		double tankshell_velocityX = 2
		double tankshell_velocityY = 1
		//Gravity on block (Example value)
		double gravity  = -0.10
		//Check for collison with terrain blocks
		//if collsion destory a ceartain amount of terrain
			tankShellExplosion()
	void tankShellExplosion()
		int radius = 3;
		//remove blocks from terrain or disable collision
		
Req 1.2.1
	The projectile block shall be implemented in the buldier.py file. The block’s number will be equal to 24.
   The texture for the block will be added in the textures folder, in the texture.png file.
Code:        
	TANK_SHELL = 24
