6.1 Tools Used to Create Diagram
Req 1.0
	Creation of tank the the player will be able to use.
Code:
	Def  Tank():         Def  Tank(x,x1,y,z)
				                    // Dimensions of the tank
				                    result = set()
				                    return result
Req 1.0.1
	Rules for tank movement.
Code:
	void tankMovement()
	     	// Speed is just for an example value
		// Will move with same controls as character
		int tank_velocity = 2;
		//Block height 1 more than current level of tank automatically move on top of block
Req 1.0.2
	Despawn the tank after 5 collisions with projectile block.
Code:
	int tankHealth()
		int tankHp = 5;
		//Check for collision with projectile block
		//If collision tankHp--
		if(tankHp == 0)
			// boot player out of tank and delete tank object
		return tankHp;	
Req 1.1, 1.2, 1.2.2, 1.2.3
	While in the tank right click will shoot a projectile out of the tank, within the function tankShellExplosion()
	it will take care of the destructable terrain.
Code:
	void fireTankShell()
		double tankShell_y = tankHeight
		//Speed of projectile in X and Y direction to get a range of 15 blocks on a flat surface
		//Speeds below are for an example
		double tankshell_velocityX = 2
		double tankshell_velocityY = 1
		//Gravity on block (Example value)
		double gravity  = -0.10
		tankshell_velocityY + gravity
		//Check for collison with terrain blocks
		//if collsion destory a ceartain amount of terrain
			tankShellExplosion()
	void tankShellExplosion()
		int radius = 3;
		//remove blocks from terrain or disable collision
		
Req 1.2.1
	Add new block to item.h and item.cpp
Code:        
	#define TANK_SHELL 64 in the item.h
	TANK_SHELL In items[] in the item.cpp file
