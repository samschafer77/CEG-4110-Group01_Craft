## Craft Voxel Engine Tank Game
This will add a tank minigame to this Minecraft clone. When completed the user can type into the console "/play tank minigame", 
this will spawn the user as a tank into an arena to battle an opposing enemy tank using missile blocks. The terrain of the arena is
completely destructible and both the user and npc enemy tank have five health points that decrease for every
tank missile that hits them.

### Download

Mac and Windows binaries are available on the website.

http://www.michaelfogleman.com/craft/

See below to run from source.

### Install Dependencies

#### Mac OS X

Download and install [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
if you don't already have it. You may use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) to simplify
the installation:

    brew install cmake

#### Linux (Ubuntu)

    sudo apt-get install cmake libglew-dev xorg-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
    sudo apt-get build-dep glfw

#### Windows

Download and install [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
and [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/). Add `C:\MinGW\bin` to your `PATH`.

Download and install [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/download.html) so that
CURL/lib and CURL/include are in your Program Files directory.

Use the following commands in place of the ones described in the next section.

    cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles"
    mingw32-make

### Compile and Run

Once you have the dependencies (see above), run the following commands in your
terminal.

    git clone https://github.com/fogleman/Craft.git
    cd Craft
    cmake .
    make
    ./craft

### Multiplayer

Register for an account!

#### Client

You can connect to a server with command line arguments...

    ./craft craft.michaelfogleman.com

Or, with the "/online" command in the game itself.

    /online craft.michaelfogleman.com

#### Server

You can run your own server or connect to mine. The server is written in Python
but requires a compiled DLL so it can perform the terrain generation just like
the client.

    gcc -std=c99 -O3 -fPIC -shared -o world -I src -I deps/noise deps/noise/noise.c src/world.c
    python server.py [HOST [PORT]]
